Airports for MSFS: 35AZ CONTINENTAL

To install, drag and drop "airport-az35-continental" into your Community folder for MSFS 2020.

"airport-az35-continental" adds a large airfield on the other side of the road to the west of the actual dirt airstrip. 

This new airfield works for FSEconomy as it is close enough to the original to register a successful landing.

Continental now has ~5000' of asphalt on RNWY02/20 with edge lights, end lights, center lights, and taxiway lights.

Parking spot 0 and 1 are made for Helo Ops.

There are 3 other spots for spawning small/medium aircraft.

There are some terraforming issues on the north end of the apron. I plan to resolve these in a future patch.

Additionally, there are some default buildings rendering on the north end of the apron. These will be resolved in a future patch as well.

While this was initially intended to simply add a helipad to 35AZ, I ended up using it as a testbed to learn to create more robust airports.

There are no RNAV or ILS approaches to this airfield. Landings are typically done direct to a helo pad or via RNWY20 from the north.

The actual ICAO for this airfield is 35AZ. I'll probably fix this in a future patch if it doesn't break everything when I do.

Future patch "to do" list:

-Add apron lighting

-Add beacon

-Add terraforming polygon to fix issues on the north end of the apron and exclude default models

-Add more parking locations

-Add taxi lines

Airports for MSFS: TX72 WOOD TRIPLE D

To install, drag and drop "airport-tx72-woodtripled" into your Community folder for MSFS 2020.

"airport-tx72-woodtripled" changes an empty field into two short dirt runways 9/27 (~1500' of dirt) and 2/20 (~1000' of dirt) and a helipad 

This new airport works for FSEconomy

Parking spot 0 is made for Helo Ops. Spots 1, 2, and 3 are for small GA aircraft.

There are some terraforming issues on the 09 and 20 ends of the runways (more serious on 09). I hope to resolve these in a future patch.

I started this as a way to add a single helipad but realized this location actually had two dirt runways listed in the ICAO info.

I added a texture to help more clearly mark these runways and augmented with edgelights, end lights and centerline lights.

This location has apron lighting for all four parking spots.

There are no RNAV or ILS appraoches for this field. Landings are typically done direct to the helipad or via RNWY20 or RNWY27

Future patch "to do" list:

-Fix terraforming on runways

-Add beacon
